// Ztoryc: the Sync with Kitsu, out of the tracker (2026-09-27).
//
// One object for the whole app. It runs the four steps of «⇄ Sync with
// Kitsu» and applies to the model what Kitsu sends back — shot and asset ids,
// statuses (three-way merge on the base, ZtoryTaskFlow::mergeFromServer),
// assets created on Kitsu, the team. The tracker is only the button, the
// confirmation and the label.
//
// It used to live in the tracker's constructor: seven handlers testing a step
// number, and ~400 lines of model logic inside UI lambdas — run once PER OPEN
// TRACKER, so two trackers (room + floating) applied every pull twice.
//
// The steps. The pushes come first: each sends only what changed in Ztoryc
// since the last sync, and only over the base Kitsu still has. The pulls
// then merge on the base.
//   1 shots to Kitsu (entities, then task statuses)
//   2 assets to Kitsu (entities, then task statuses)
//   3 assets from Kitsu (new entities, then task statuses)
//   4 team + shot statuses from Kitsu
//   5 breakdown, both ways (three-way merge on each shot's base, then the
//     shots whose merged breakdown differs from Kitsu's are written)
//   6 asset previews: the picture of each asset's file, on its task in
//     progress and as its cover, again only when the file changed
